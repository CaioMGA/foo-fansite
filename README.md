## About the band
Every year since 2018 (except 2020 due to Covid restrictions), on October 1st, Andrew Huang and Rob Scallon try to record an album in one day. They compose, perform and record all songs from said album in a single day. To be more precise, they do all that in 12 hours.

## About the site
Fansite created as a hommage to First of October.

This site does not use any JavaScript framework. The audio and video shown in the site are from Youtube due to its convenience (it's free, available worldwide, and fast). The site is self-hosted

I decided to create this site because this is the only band I look forward to their next album every year.
